# Img-Classification_with_DeepLearning
DeepLearning has soo many Convolutional models that work together (in a linked way) to get the task done, that would be like our neural system, so they are called Neural Networks
- in the above code I've used  `tensorflow's` `keras` model which is a CNN that is flexible, we can decide the no .of layers in the neural network and what layer at which level.
- for image classification I've used, the famous **MNIST** data which contains 70,000 images of hand written digits from 0-9, **MNIST-Fashion** which has same no of images but it has images offashion wear.
- the next dataset I've used is **CIFAR-10** which has images of 10 categories.

All the above data I've used for training and testing the model
